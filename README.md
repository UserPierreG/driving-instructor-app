## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **MongoDB**: [Download and install MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (or use a cloud-based solution like MongoDB Atlas)
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js (if you prefer `yarn`, install it [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/))

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies:**

   Navigate to the server directory (if your server is in a subdirectory like server):

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies:**

   Navigate to the client directory (if your client is in a subdirectory like client):

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a .env file in the server directory and add your environment variables. For example:
   Replace yourdbname and your_jwt_secret with your actual database name and secret key.

   ```bash
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourdbname
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   PORT=5000
   ```

## Running the Application

  Create two terminals one for the frontend and one for the backend

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```
