# Driving Instructor App

Welcome to the Driving Instructor App! This is a simple app built with MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. Below you'll find instructions on how to set up, run, and contribute to this project.


## Installation

1. **Clone and create your own branch:**

   ```bash
   git clone -b main --single-branch https://github.com/UserPierreG/driving-instructor-app.git <your-branch-name>
   
   cd <your-branch-name>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Open two terminals: one for the frontend and one for the backend. Navigate to each directory and install the dependencies. 

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

   Contact me, and I'll provide you with the .env file that needs to be placed in the backend directory. This file contains database credentials and other sensitive information required for the application.

## Running the Application

   Start the frontend and backend applications in their respective terminals.

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```
